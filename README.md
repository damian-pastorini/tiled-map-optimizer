# Tilemap Optimizer

Merge multiple tilesets images into one and get the proper tiledmap for it based on your multiple tileset tiledmap.

Have you created a map with Tiled? (https://www.mapeditor.org)

Does your map include multiple Tilesets and you are using just a few tiles from each image?

Then you can use this optimizer to get a single merged PNG image and all the data-layers fixed to use the optimized image.

Got the result image? You can even try to optimize more with: https://tinypng.com
